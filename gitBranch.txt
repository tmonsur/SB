## **Part I**

Answer the following questions:
- What ***git*** command creates a branch?
  git branch branch_name

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
  Fast-forward merge is a simple linear integration when there is no divergence between branches.
  Recursive merge is needed when branches have diverged, resulting in the creation of a new merge commit. 
  The choice between them depends on the branch histories and the desired structure of the commit history. 
  Fast-forward merges are generally cleaner and more straightforward, but they are not always possible 
  when working with branches that have diverged.

- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
  git checkout branch_name

- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
  git branch -d/D branch_name

- How do merge conflicts happen?
  Merge conflict occur when git cannot merge branches automatically and require human intervension. Usually if a user
  attempts to merge 2 branches that have same filename but different contents, git will not be able to decide which changes
  to keep and which to discard. In that case, the user will have to decide on what changes to be kept and merge the branches.
